0.1 initial release

0.2 more verbose output to help debugging, write measurements to file (if wanted), write pid to file if daemon, set user to run as, read-only mode, setting of fudge factor added, max. offset configurable, configurable sleep interval, time/daytime can now set port, added measurements statistics, added support for the snts protocol

0.3 added irc protocol

0.4 added initially stepping; this speeds up initial syncing and solves the problem where the initial offset is too large for ntpd

0.5 added ICMP TIMESTAMP request ("syncing via ping requests")

0.6 now correctly sets the precision for icmp timestamp, now compiles on IRIX as well, initial clock set can now use average of multiple measurements, added synchronizing against an SNMP server

0.7 implemented proper timeouts, added simple PTP handler (version 1 only currently and not the complete interaction between server and client, just receiving)

0.8 now one can select what ip address to accept for broadcasts (snts and ptp), added syncing against an (S)NTP server via a Socks5 proxy
